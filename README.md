# RBM 4 Pixel-Level Multispectral Image Segmentation

This project focuses on segmenting hyperspectral images using restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) techniques. Hyperspectral images are rich in information, but their analysis and segmentation require advanced data processing techniques. In this project, we leverage RBMs to identify and segment different regions in hyperspectral images, which can significantly facilitate data analysis and understanding.
